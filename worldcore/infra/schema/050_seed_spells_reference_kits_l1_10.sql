-- worldcore/infra/schema/050_seed_spells_reference_kits_l1_10.sql
-- DEPRECATED (System 5.4):
-- This file previously seeded a different set of spell ids (e.g., archmage_arcane_missiles, warlock_hex_bolt).
-- The canonical System 5.4 L1–10 reference kit seed is now:
--   050_seed_reference_class_kits_L1_10.sql
--
-- Keeping this file as a no-op prevents accidental double-seeding in environments that already reference it.
